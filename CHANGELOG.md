### Added

- OpenAI-compatible Axum proxy and MCP interception routes.
- Bounded asynchronous workers with loop detection, OCSF emission, Bridge publication, ATIF capture, and signed chains.
- Idempotent session close, client-abort finalization, idle reconciliation, and retroactive receipts.
- Embedded, Kafka/Redpanda, and NATS Bridge backends with manifest provisioning.
- In-memory and Redis atomic state backends.
- Hash and ONNX embedding backends plus optional Qdrant persistence.
- Ed25519 JWKS refresh and HS256 development identity support.
- `abctl` operations, load generation, schemas, Docker Compose, and Vector configuration.
- Bounded byte-oriented SSE/non-SSE capture with fragmented UTF-8 and tool-call reassembly.
- Authenticated, torn-tail-tolerant signed and unsigned crash journals with exact receipt reuse.
- Durable lifecycle and cold-export outboxes with persisted acknowledgments.
- JSON-RPC-id tool execution claims, cached outcomes, and close-through-completion leases.
- Session-ordered parallel worker shards and concurrent deadline-bounded broker connectors.
- Qdrant similarity participation, masked ONNX mean pooling, and strict output-shape checks.
- Kafka retention verification, AOF-backed Redis, customer-volume cold tier, and object-store retries.
- Batched OTLP/HTTP traces to Vector with request/worker parent propagation and bounded shutdown.

- Mandatory CI image build, live backend contracts, and a true 10,000-connection release gate.
